## Description

In this Challenge, I used Node.js, Express, Sequelize, and Express-Sessions to create a Dynamic CMS-Style Tech Blog where Users can read about topics others have posted, or Login to post their own blogs and articles. The User's login details are encrypted with the bcrypt library to ensure security of passwords stored in the database. The app is deployed via Heroku and uses JawsDB for the blog's database.
